00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
